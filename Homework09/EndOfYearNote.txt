 Dr. Spickler,
 
 I believe a professor capable of helping students learn what they enjoy, or are interested in, as effectively and naturally as you should be recognized.
 
 You are one of the greatest teachers I have had. I thank you greatly for the work you put into this class, as well as your impressive authenticity.
 
 Thank you once again,
 Logan Kelsch
